# Course management system
A system for interaction between teachers and students. Students are added to their groups. Each group has subjects assigned to specific teachers. Teachers post tasks, students send their answers and receive grades from teachers. Students are notified of new tasks, and teachers are notified when a new answer to the task is sent.
